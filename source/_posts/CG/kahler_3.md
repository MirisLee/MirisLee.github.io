As another application of the Hodge theory on compact K&#228;hler manifolds, the Lefschetz decomposition of the de Rham cohomology groups is of great importance as well as the Hodge decomposition. We will use the representation theory of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ to give a proof of the hard Lefschetz theorem, and discuss the Hodge index theorem which is regared as a corollary of this decomposition in this post. 

## Representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$

<!-- definition -->

Recall that the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ consists of $2 \times 2$ complex matrices with trace zero, with the Lie bracket given by $$[A, B] = AB - BA, \quad A, B \in \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C}).$$ As a vector space, $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ has a basis given by $$X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad Y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad H = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}.$$ $X$, $Y$ and $H$ generates the whole Lie algebra with the relations $$[X, Y] = H, \quad [H, X] = 2X, \quad [H, Y] = -2Y.$$

For a finite dimensional vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{C}$, we have the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ of endomorphisms on $V$. A **representation** of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ is given as a Lie algebra homomorphism $$\rho : \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathfrak{gl}(V),$$ and then $V$ is called a **$\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-module**. This is equivalent to give $\rho(X), \rho(Y), \rho(H) \in \mathfrak{gl}(V)$ satisfying the same relations as $X, Y, H \in \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$. For $v \in V$, we may write $\rho(X)v$ (*resp.* $\rho(Y)v, \rho(H)v$) simply as $Xv$ (*resp.* $Yv, Hv$) for short if $\rho$ is clear from the context. A subspace $W$ of $V$ is called a **$\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-submodule**, or simply, a **submodule**, if $W$ is closed under the action of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$. $V$ is called **irreducible** if $V$ has no nontrivial submodule, i.e., if $W \subset V$ is a submodule, then either $W = 0$ or $W = V$. 

A result in the representation theory of Lie algebras tells that for any submodule $W \subset V$, there exists another submodule $U \subset V$ such that $V = U \oplus W$. It follows that any $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-module can be decomposed into the direct sum of irreducible submodules.

<!-- irreducible cases -->

Now suppose $V$ is an irreducible $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-module. We want to study the further structure of $V$. The eigenspaces of $H$, which are also called **weight spaces**, are considered in our analysis. 

Suppose $v \in V$ is a nonzero eigenvector of $H$ with respect to the eigenvalue $\lambda$. Then since $$HXv = XHv + [H, X]v = \lambda \cdot Xv + 2Xv = (\lambda + 2)Xv$$ $$HYv = YHv + [H, Y]v = \lambda \cdot Yv - 2Yv = (\lambda - 2)Yv,$$ $Xv$ and $Yv$ are both eigenvectors of $H$. Moreover, if $Xv$ (*resp.* $Yv$) is nonzero, then $v$ and $Xv$ (*resp.* $Yv$) are linearly independent as they are eigenvectors with respect to different eigenvalues. Since $V$ is finite dimensional, there exists $k > 0$ such that $X^kv = Y^kv = 0$. 

We say a vector $v \in V$ is **primitive** if $v$ is a nonzero eigenvector of $H$ with $Xv = 0$. By the above discussion we see that primitive vectors exist. 

**Proposition.** Suppose $v \in V$ is primitive. Then $V$ is generated (as a vector space) by $v, Yv, Y^2v, \cdots$. 

> *Proof:* Since $V$ is irreducible, it suffices to show that the subspace $W$ generated by $v, Yv, Y^2v, \cdots$ is a submodule. As $Y^kv$ are all eigenvectors of $H$, it is clear that $W$ is closed under the action of $Y$ and $H$. Suppose $Hv = \lambda v$. We show by induction that $$XY^kv = k(\lambda - k + 1)Y^{k-1}v, \quad k \geq 0,$$ which certainly implies that $W$ is closed under $X$. 
>
> For $k = 0$, $Xv = 0$ comes from the definition of the primitive property. Assume the above formula holds for $k$. Then for $k + 1$, we have $$XY^{k+1}v = YXY^kv + HY^kv = k(\lambda - k + 1) \cdot Y^kv + (\lambda - 2k) Y^kv = (k + 1)(\lambda - k) Y^kv,$$ completes the induction.

**Corollary.** $V$ can be decomposed into the eigenspaces of $H$ as $$V = V_\lambda \oplus V_{\lambda - 2} \oplus V_{\lambda - 4} \oplus \cdots,$$ where each $V_\mu$ is the eigenspace of $H$ with respect to $\mu$, and has dimensional one. 

**Corollary.** Suppose the dimensional of $V$ is $n$. Then $$V = V_{n-1} \oplus V_{n-3} \oplus \cdots \oplus V_{-n+3} \oplus V_{-n+1}.$$

> *Proof:* Take a primitive vector $v \in V$, with the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $H$. Since $V$ is $n$-dimensional, we have $Y^{n-1}v \neq 0$ and $Y^nv = 0$. Then $$0 = XY^nv = n(\lambda - n + 1)Y^{n-1}v,$$ implying that $\lambda = n - 1$.

<!-- general cases -->

We may generalize the above stucture theorem of irreducible $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-modules. Suppose $V$ is a (finite-dimensional) $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-module which is not necessarily irreducible. Consider the decomposition of $V$ into irreducible submodules: $$V = V^1 \oplus \cdots \oplus V^r,$$ with each $V^i$ irreducible. Let $P = \mathrm{ker} X$. Then $P \cap V^i$ is exactly the $1$-dimensional subspace of $V^i$ generated by a primitive element, and it is also clear that $P$ is the direct sum of such $P \cap V^i$. Since each $V^i$ satisfies that $$V^i = (P \cap V^i) \oplus Y(P \cap V^i) \oplus Y^2(P \cap V^i) \oplus \cdots,$$ we obtain the decompostion of $V$ as $$V = P \oplus YP \oplus Y^2P \oplus \cdots.$$ 

As each $V^i$ is decomposed into eigensubspaces of $H$, so is $V$. The decomposition into weight spaces and the decomposition into irreducibles are directly compatible, implying that $$V_\lambda = \bigoplus_{k \geq 0} Y^kP \cap V_\lambda = \bigoplus_{k \geq 0} Y^k(P \cap V_{\lambda + 2k}).$$ We can also see that $$P \cap V_m = \mathrm{ker} (Y^{m+1} : V_m \to V_{-m-2}), \quad m \geq 0.$$

Since for each $V^i$ and $m \geq 0$, $$Y^m : V^i \cap V_m \to V^i \cap V_{-m}, \quad X^m : V^i \cap V_{-m} \to V^i \cap V_m$$ are both isomorphisms, it follows that $$Y^m : V_m \to V_{-m}, \quad X^m : V_{-m} \to V_m$$ are isomorphisms as well. 

## Lefschetz decompostion and Hodge index theorem

<!-- $\mathfrak{al}_2(\mathbb{C})$ representation on $H^*(M; \mathbb{C})$ -->

Suppose $M$ is a compact K&#228;hler manifold of dimensional $n$ with the K&#228;hler form $\omega$. A $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ action on the $2n$-dimensional space $H^\*(M; \mathbb{C}) = \bigoplus_r H^r(M; \mathbb{C})$ will be introduced in order to apply the above results. 

**Lemma.** The operators $L$ and $\Lambda$ on $A(M)$ commute with $\Delta_\mathrm{d}$. 

> *Proof:* Recall that we have $$[L, \partial] = 0, \quad [L, \partial^\*] = i\bar{\partial}, \quad \Delta_\mathrm{d} = 2 \Delta_\partial.$$ Thus $$[L, \Delta_\mathrm{d}] = 2[L, \partial\partial^\* + \partial^\*\partial] = 2(\partial[L, \partial^\*] + [L, \partial^\*]\partial) = 2i(\partial\bar{\partial} + \bar{\partial}\partial) = 0.$$ Taking the dual operators, we see that $$[\Lambda, \Delta_\mathrm{d}] = -[L, \Delta_\mathrm{d}]^\* = 0.$$

By this lemma, $L$ and $\Lambda$ give well-defined operators on $\mathcal{H}(M)$. Using the natural isomorphism $\mathcal{H}(M) \cong H^\*(M; \mathbb{C})$, we obtain operators $$L, \Lambda : H^\*(M; \mathbb{C}) \to H^\*(M; \mathbb{C}).$$ It worth noting that $L$ can be expressed as $$L([\alpha]) = [\omega \wedge \alpha], \quad [\alpha] \in H^r(M; \mathbb{C}).$$

In view of the Hodge decomposition, $H^{p,q}(M)$ is considered as a subspace of $H^{p+q}(M; \mathbb{C}) \subset H^\*(M; \mathbb{C})$. Let $$\pi^r : H^\*(M; \mathbb{C}) \to H^r(M; \mathbb{C}), \quad \pi^{p,q} : H^\*(M; \mathbb{C}) \to H^{p,q}(M)$$ be the projection, and consider $$\Pi = \sum_{p,q} (n - p - q)\pi^{p,q} = \sum_{r=0}^{2n} (n - r)\pi^r.$$ We obtain in the previous post that $$[\Lambda, L] = \Pi.$$ As $L$ maps $H^r(M; \mathbb{C})$ into $H^{r+2}(M; \mathbb{C})$ and $\Lambda$ does the converse thing, it is also direct to see that $$[\Pi, \Lambda] = 2\Lambda, \quad [\Pi, L] = -2L.$$ Therefore we have a representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ on $H^\*(M; \mathbb{C})$ by $$\rho : \mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathfrak{gl}(H^\*(M; \mathbb{C}))$$ with $$\rho(X) = \Lambda, \quad \rho(Y) = L, \quad \rho(H) = \Pi.$$

<!-- hard Lefschetz theorem -->

Applying the description of the structure of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-modules, and noting that $H^r(M; \mathbb{C})$ is exactly the eigenspace of $\Pi$ with respect to the eigenvalue $n - r$, we obtain the following Lefschetz decompostion.

**Theorem (Hard Lefschetz theorem).** Suppose $M$ is an $n$-dimensional compact K&#228;hler manifold. Then the map $$L^k : H^{n-k}(M; \mathbb{C}) \xrightarrow{\sim} H^{n+k}(M; \mathbb{C})$$ is an isomorphism for $0 \leq k \leq n$. Define the **primitive cohomology** by $$P^{n-k}(M) = \mathrm{ker} \Lambda \cap H^{n-k}(M; \mathbb{C}),$$ then we have $$P^{n-k}(M) = \mathrm{ker} (L^{k+1} : H^{n-k}(M; \mathbb{C}) \to H^{n+k+2}(M; \mathbb{C})),$$ and the **Lefschetz decomposition** $$H^r(M; \mathbb{C}) = \bigoplus_{0 \leq 2k \leq r} L^k P^{r - 2k}(M).$$

By considering the bidegree of differential forms, we see that the Lefschetz decomposition is compatible with the Hodge decomposition, that is $$P^r(M) = \bigoplus_{p + q = r} P^{p,q}(M), \quad P^{p,q}(M) = \mathrm{ker}\Lambda \cap H^{p,q}(M).$$ There is also an isomorphism $$L^{n-p-q} : H^{p,q}(M) \xrightarrow{\sim} H^{n-q,n-p}(M)$$ for each $p$ and $q$.

<!-- Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations -->

As an application of the Hodge decomposition and the Lefschetz decomposition, we introduce the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations and the Hodge index theorem. 

Consider the bilinear form $Q$ on $H^{n-k}(M; \mathbb{C})$ given by $$Q(\alpha, \beta) = \int_M \alpha \wedge \beta \wedge \omega^k, \quad \alpha, \beta \in H^{n-k}(M; \mathbb{C}).$$ As $\omega$ is a real form, $Q$ defined a real bilinnear form on $H^{n-k}(M; \mathbb{R})$. Comparing the bidegree of forms, we see that when $\alpha \in H^{p,q}(M)$ and $\beta \in H^{p',q'}(M)$, we have $Q(\alpha, \beta) = 0$ unless $p = q'$ and $q = p'$. 

**Lemma.** Suppose $\alpha \in A^{p,q}(M) \subset A^r(M)$ satisfies that $\Lambda\alpha$ vanishes at $x \in M$, then $$\*\alpha = (-1)^{r(r-1)/2} i^{p-q} \frac{L^{n-r}}{(n - r)!}\bar{\alpha}$$ holds at $x$. 

This lemma can be shown by direct computation in a local orthonormal frame. 

**Theorem (Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations).** Suppose $M$ is an $n$-dimensional compact K&#228;hler manifold. Then for a nonzero $\alpha \in P^{p,q} \subset P^r$, we have $$(-1)^{r(r-1)/2}i^{p-q}Q(\alpha, \bar{\alpha}) > 0.$$ 

> *Proof:* Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\alpha \neq 0$ is a harmonic $(p,q)$-form such that $\Lambda \alpha = 0$ everywhere. Then by the lemma we have $$(-1)^{r(r-1)/2}i^{p-q}Q(\alpha, \bar{\alpha}) = (-1)^{r(r-1)/2}i^{p-q} \int_M \alpha \wedge L^{n-r}\bar{\alpha} = \int_M \alpha \wedge \*\alpha = \\\|\alpha\\\|^2 > 0.$$

Note that $Q(L\alpha, L\beta) = Q(\alpha, \beta)$, we obtain from the Lefschetz decomposition that $Q$ is nondegenerate on $H^{n-k}(M; \mathbb{C})$. Meanwhile, the bilinear relations also imply the positive definite property of the quadratic form $(-1)^{r(r-1)/2}i^{p-q}Q$ on $$(P^{p,q}(M) \oplus P^{q,p}(M)) \cap H^r(M; \mathbb{R}) \subset H^r(M; \mathbb{C})$$ (or simply $P^{p,p}(M) \oplus H^{2p}(M; \mathbb{R})$ if $p = q$) when $r = p + q$ is even.  

<!-- Hodge index theorem -->

Recall that for a general $2m$-dimensional real compact oriented smooth manifold $M$, the Poincar&#233; duality yields a nondegenerate bilinear form $F$ on $H^m(M; \mathbb{R})$ by $$F(\xi, \eta) = \int_M \xi \wedge \eta, \quad \xi, \eta \in H^m(M; \mathbb{R}).$$ The **index** $\mathrm{ind}(M)$ of $M$ is defined to be the signature of the quadratic form $F$ on $H^m(M; \mathbb{R})$. 

Specifying the case when $M$ is a $2m$-dimensional compact K&#228;hler manifold, it is clear that $Q$ agrees with $F$ on $H^{2m}(M; \mathbb{R})$. The Lefschetz decompostion tells us $$H^{2m}(M; \mathbb{C}) = \bigoplus_{0 \leq k \leq m} L^kP^{2(m-k)}(M) = \bigoplus_{2 \mid r, p + q = r \leq 2m} L^{m-r/2}P^{p,q}(M),$$ and considering the real part, we obtain $$H^{2m}(M; \mathbb{R}) = \bigoplus_{2 \mid r, r \leq 2m} L^{m-r/2}\left[\left(\bigoplus_{p < q, p + q = r} (P^{p,q}(M) \oplus P^{q,p}(M)) \cap H^r(M; \mathbb{R})\right) \oplus (P^{r/2,r/2}(M) \cap H^r(M; \mathbb{R}))\right].$$ 

By the corollary of the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations, it holds that $$\mathrm{ind}(M) = \sum_{2 \mid p + q \leq 2m} (-1)^{(p+q)(p+q-1)/2}i^{p-q} \dim P^{p,q}(M) = \sum_{2 \mid p + q \leq 2m} (-1)^p \dim P^{p,q}(M).$$

**Theorem (Hodge index theorem).** Suppose $M$ is a $2m$-dimensional compact K&#228;hler manifold, then $$\mathrm{ind}(M) = \sum_{p,q=0}^{2m} (-1)^p h^{p,q}(M).$$

> *Proof:* By the Lefschetz decompostion, we have $$h^{p,p+k} = \sum_{j=0}^p \dim P^{j,j+k}, \quad k \geq 0.$$ Together with the above formula of $\mathrm{ind}(M)$ and the symmetric properties of $h^{p,q}$, direct computation yields that $$\mathrm{ind}(M) = \sum_{2 \mid p + q} (-1)^p h^{p,q}(M).$$ It is also direct that $$\sum_{2 \not\mid p + q} (-1)^p h^{p,q}(M) = 0,$$ implying the final conclusion.
