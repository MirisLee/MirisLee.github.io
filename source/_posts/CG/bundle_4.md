After we have connections on a vector bundle, we may consider its curvature just as what we did in Riemannian geometry. Furthermore, using the curvature, the Chern class is introduces to characterze vector bundles on a manifold. However, the Chern class turns out to be independent of the connection and hence gives us an important tool in the study of the topology of manifolds and bundles. 

## Curvature of a connection

<!-- Definition -->
Recall that a connection $D$ on a complex vector bundle $\pi : E \to M$ is given as a sheaf homomorphism $$D : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^1_M(E).$$ We see that $D$ is not a homomorphism of $\mathcal{A}^0_M$-modules, as $D$ is required to satisfy the Leibniz' rule $$D(fs) = \mathrm{d}f \otimes s + f \cdot D(s).$$ The connection $D$ can be extended into sheaf homomorphisms $$D : \mathcal{A}^p_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^{p+1}_M(E)$$ by $$D(\omega \otimes s) = \mathrm{d}\omega \otimes s + (-1)^p \omega \wedge D(s),$$ where $\omega \in A^p_\mathbb{C}(U)$ and $s \in \mathcal{A}^0_M(E)(U)$ are given on an open subset $U \subset M$. This is well-defined as we can verify that $$D(\omega \otimes fs) = f\mathrm{d}\omega \otimes s + (-1)^p \omega \wedge (\mathrm{d}f \otimes s + f \cdot D(s)) = \mathrm{d}(f\omega) \otimes s + (-1)^p f\omega \wedge D(s) = D(f\omega \otimes s).$$ We see that the generalized Leibniz' rule is satisfied, that is for any $\omega \in A^p_\mathbb{C}(U)$ and $\sigma \in \mathcal{A}^q_M(E)(U)$, we have $$D(\omega \wedge \sigma) = \mathrm{d}omega \wedge \sigma + (-1)^p \omega \wedge D(\sigma).$$ 

Thus we may consider the decompostion of $D$ with itself $$D^2 : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^2_M(E).$$ For a local section $s$ of $E$ and a local smooth function $f$, we have $$D^2(fs) = D(\mathrm{d}f \otimes s + f \cdot D(s)) = \mathrm{d}^2f \otimes s - \mathrm{d}f \otimes D(s) + \mathrm{d}f \otimes D(s) + f \cdot D^2(s) = f \cdot D^2(s).$$ This shows that $D^2$ is a homomorphism of $\mathcal{A}^0_M$-modules. Consequently, $D^2$ may be identified with a global section $\Omega$ of the bundle $\wedge^2 T^*_\mathbb{C}(M) \otimes \mathrm{End}(E)$, where $\mathrm{End}(E)$ is the bundle of endomorphisms of $E$ and is usually isdentified with $E^* \otimes E$. The $\mathrm{End}(E)$-valued $2$-form $\Omega$ is called the **curvature** of the connection $D$.

Suppose $e^1, \cdots, e^r$ form a local frame of $E$ and with respect to this frame the connection matrix of $D$ is $A = (\omega^j_k)$, i.e., $$D(e^j) = \sum_{k=1}^r \omega^j_k \otimes e^k, \quad j = 1, \cdots, r.$$ We can express $\Omega$ as a matrix $\Theta = (\Theta^j_k)$ of $2$-forms locally by $$D^2(e^j) = \sum_{k=1}^r \Theta^j_k e^k.$$ Direct computation yields that $$D^2(e^j) = \sum_{k=1}^r (\mathrm{d}\omega^j_k \otimes e^k - \omega^j_k \wedge D(e^k)) = \sum_{k=1}^r \left(\mathrm{d}\omega^j_k - \sum_{l=1}^r \omega^j_l \wedge \omega^l_k\right) \otimes e^k.$$ Thus $$\Theta^j_k = \mathrm{d}\omega^j_k - \sum{l=1}^r \omega^j_l \wedge \omega^l_k,$$ i.e., $$\Theta = \mathrm{d}A - A \wedge A.$$ The matrix $\Theta = (\Theta^j_k)$ is called the *curvature matrix* of $D$ with respect to the local frame $e^1, \cdots, e^r$. Consider another local frame $\tilde{e}^1, \cdots, \tilde{e}^r$ with corresponding curvature matrix $\tilde{\Theta}$. If the relations between $\tilde{e}^1, \cdots, \tilde{e}^r$ and $e^1, \cdots, e^r$ is given by the matrix $G = (g^j_k)$, i.e., $$\tilde{e}^j = \sum_{k=1}^r g^j_k e^k,$$ then we can compute that $$\tilde{\Theta} = G \cdot \Theta \cdot G^{-1}.$$ This verifies the tensorial property of $D^2$ and $\Omega$. 

Additional properties of the vector bundle $E$ and the connection $D$ yields addition properties of the curvature $\Omega$. If $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle and $D$ is a complex connection, then considering a holomorphic frame of $E$ yields that $(D^2)^{0,2} = 0$, i.e., $\Omega^{0,2} = 0$. If $E$ is further a hermitian vector bundle, then we may consider an orthonormal frame $e^1, \cdots, e^k$. With respect to this frame, we have $$0 = \mathrm{d}h(e^j, e^k) = h(De^j, e^k) + h(e^j, De^k) = \omega^k_j + \bar{\omega}^j_k,$$ and hence $$\bar{\Theta}^k_j = \mathrm{d}\bar{\omega}^k_j - \sum_{l=1}^r \bar{\omega}^k_l \wedge \bar{\omega}^l_j = -\mathrm{d}\omega^j_k + \sum_{l=1}^r \bar{\omega}^j_l \wedge \bar{\omega}^l_k = -\Theta^j_k,$$ i.e., $$\bar{\Theta}^\mathrm{T} = -\Theta.$$ Thus $$\Theta^{2,0} = -\bar{\Theta^{0,2}}^\mathrm{T} = 0,$$ implying that $\Omega^{2,0} = 0$. Thus $\Omega$ is of type $(1,1)$ and is skew-hermitian.

<!-- induced connections and curvature -->

Given connections and curvature on some vector bundles, we can consider the induced connections and curvature on induced bundles, including direct sum, tensor product, dual bundle, and pullback.

+ Suppose $E_1$ and $E_2$ are vector bundles on $M$ with corresponding connections $D_1, D_2$ and curvature $\Omega_1, \Omega_2$. Then we have a natural connection on the direct sum given as $$D = \begin{pmatrix} D_1 & \\ & D_2 \end{pmatrix} : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_1 \oplus E_2) \to \mathcal{A}^1_M(E_1 \oplu E_2).$$ The corresponding curvature is clearly $$\Omega = \begin{pmatrix} \Omega_1 & \\ & \Omega_2 \end{pmatrix} \in \mathcal{A}^2_M(E_1 \oplus E_2)(M).$$
+ Similarly we have a natural connection on the tensor product $E_1 \otimes E_2$ given as $$D = D_1 \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes D_2 : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_1 \otimes E_2) \to \mathcal{A}^1_M(E_1 \otimes E_2)),$$ where $$D_1 \otimes 1 : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_1 \otimes E_2) = \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_1) \otimes_{\mathcal{A}^0_M} \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_2) \to \mathcal{A}^1_M(E_1) \otimes_{\mathcal{A}^0_M} \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_2) = \mathcal{A}^1_M(E_1 \otimes E_2)$$ and $$1 \otimes D_2 : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_1 \otimes E_2) = \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_1) \otimes_{\mathcal{A}^0_M} \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_2) \to \mathcal{A}^0_M(E_1) \otimes_{\mathcal{A}^0_M} \mathcal{A}^1_M(E_2) = \mathcal{A}^1_M(E_1 \otimes E_2).$$ We can verify that the curvature of $D$ can be given as $$\Omega = \Omega_1 \otimes I + I \otimes \Omega_2,$$ where we use similar identifications as above. 
+ Now suppose $E$ is a vector bundle on $M$ with connection $D$ and curvatur $\Omega$. The induced connection $D^*$ on the dual bundle $E^*$ is given by the formula $$\mathrm{d}(\xi, s) = (\xi, D(s)) + (D^*(\xi), s),$$ where $\xi$ is a local section of $E^*$ and $s$ is a local section of $E$. Thus $$(D^*(D^*(\xi)),s) = \mathrm{d}(D^*(\xi),s) + (D^*(\xi), D(s)) = \mathrm{d}^2(\xi,s) - \mathrm{d}(\xi, D(s)) + \mathrm{d}(\xi, D(s)) - (\xi, D^2(s)) = -(\xi, D^2(s)).$$ With respect to a dual frame, we see that $\Omega^* = -\Omega^\mathrm{T}$.
+ Further suppose $f : N \to M$ is a smooth map. Then the pullback $f^*D$ defines a connection on the pullback bundle $f^*E$. If $A$ is the connection matrix of $D$ with respect to the frame $e^1, \cdots, e^r$ on an open subset $U \subset M$, then the connection matrix of $F^*D$ with respect to the frame $f^*e^1, \cdots, f^*e^r$ on the open set $f^{-1}(U) \subset N$ is exactly $f^*A$. Thus we can see that the curvature of $f^*D$ is nothing else than $f^*\Omega$. 

<!-- curvature of subbundle and quotient bundle -->
<!--
Suppose $\pi : E \to M$ is a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle and $F \subset E$ is a holomorphic subbundle. Then the restriction of the hermitian metric on $E$ to $F$ is a hermitian metric on $F$. The decompostion of $E$ into the direct sum $E = F \oplus F^\perp$ give an orthogonal projection $E \to F$, which induces a sheaf homomorphism $\mathcal{A}^1_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^1_M(F)$. Suppose $D_E$ is the metric connection on $E$, and $D_F$ is given as the composition $$D_F : \mathcal{A}^0_M(F) \subset \mathcal{A}^0_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^1_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^1_M(F).$$ We can see that $D_F$ is a complex connection on $F$ compatible with the hermitian metric on $F$, and hence the metric connection on $F$ by the uniqueness of such connection. 

Let $Q = E / F$ be the quotient bundle of $F$ in $E$. Then $Q$ is isomorphic to $F^\perp$ as a smooth vector bundle, and then inherits a hermitian structure from $E$. Denote the metric connection of $Q$ by $D_Q$. Consider the operator $$\Psi : \mathcal{A}^0(F) \to \mathcal{A}^1(Q)$$ given as $$\Psi(s) = D_E(s) - D_F(s)$$ for each local section $s$ of $F$. We can verify that $\Psi$ is of type $(1,0)$ and is a $\mathcal{A}^0_M$-module homomorphism, implying that $\Psi$ can be identified with a global section of the bundle $T^{1,0}(M) \otimes \mathrm{Hom}(F,Q) = T^{1,0}(M) \otimes Q \otimes F^*$, i.e., $\Psi \in \mathcal{A}^{1,0}_M(\mathrm{Hom}(F,Q))(M)$. This operator $\Psi$ is called the **second fundamental form** of $F$ in $E$. 

To compute the curvature, consider an orthonormal frame $e^1, \cdots, e^r$ of $E$ such that $e^1, \cdots, e^s$ is a frame of $F$. Then $e^{s+1}, \cdots, e^r$ is a frame of $Q$. The connection matrix of $D_E$ with respect to this frame is given by $$A_E = \begin{pmatrix} A_F & \bar{B}^\mathrm{T} \\ B & A_Q \end{pmatrix},$$ where $B$ is the matrix of $\Psi$ with respect to the frame $e^1, \cdots, e^s$ and $e^{s+1}, \cdots, e^r$. Thus the curvature can be computed as $$\Theta_E = \mathrm{d}A_E - A_E \wedge A_E = \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{d}A_F - A_F \wedge A_F - \bar{B}^\mathrm{T} \wedge B & * \\ * & \mathrm{d}A_Q - A_Q \wedge A_Q - B \wedge \bar{B}^\mathrm{T} \end{pmatrix},$$ implying that $$\Omega_F = \Omega_E|_F + \bar{\Psi}^\mathrm{T} \wedge \Psi, \quad \Omega_Q = \Omega_E|_Q + \Psi \wedge \bar{\Psi}^\mathrm{T}.$$ 

We say an operator $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}^{1,1}_M(\mathrm{End}(E))(M)$ is *positive* (*nonnegative*) if for any holomorphic tangent vector $X \in T^{1,0}_x(M)$ at a point $x \in M$, the hermitian matrix $$-i(\Omega_x; X, \bar{X}) \in \mathrm{Hom}(E_x, E_x)$$ is positive definite (semi-definite), written as $\Omega > 0$ ($\Omega \geq 0$). Using local expression of $\Psi$, we can verify that $$\Psi \wedge \bar{\Psi}^\mathrm{T} \geq 0, \quad \bar{\Psi}^\mathrm{T} \leq 0,$$ implying that $$\Omega_F \leq \Omega_E|_F, \quad \Omega_Q \geq \Omega_E|_Q.$$ This shows the principle that curvature decreases in holomorphic subbundles and increases in holomorphic quotient bundles.

As an application of the above principle, consider a holomorphic vector bundle $\pi : E \to M$ with global sections $s^1, \cdots, s^n$ such that $s^1(x), \cdots, s^n(x)$ generates $E_x$ for each $x \in M$. Then we have a surjective holomorphic bundle map $M \times \mathbb{C}^n \to E$ given by $$(x; z^1, \cdots, z^n) \mapsto \sum_{k=1}^n z^k \cdot s^k(x) \in E_x.$$ If we equips $E$ with the induced metric from the Euclidean metric on $M \times \mathbb{C}^n$, then $$\Omega_E \geq \Omega_{M \times \mathbb{C}^n}|_E = 0.$$ That is, $E$ admits a metric with nonnegative curvature. -->

## Chern classes of a vector bundle

<!-- Invariant polynomials -->
In order to define the Chern classes of a vector bundle, we need to discuss a bit about functions of matrices which are invariant under conjugation. 

Suppose $P : \mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}$ is a homogeneous polynomial function in the entries of degree $k$. We call $P$ an **invariant polynomial** if $P(A) = P(GAG^{-1})$ holds for any $A \in \mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $G \in \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. The basic examples of such polynomials are the elementary symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues of $A$. Consider the polynomials $P_k(A), k = 1, \cdots, n$ given by the formula $$\det(A + tI) = t^n + \sum_{k=1}^n P_k(A)t^{n-k}.$$ In particular, we have $P_1(A) = \mathrm{tr}(A)$, $P_n(A) = \det(A)$, and $P_k(A) = \mathrm{tr}(\wedge^k A)$ is the sum of the determinants of $k$-principal minors of $A$. These are called **elementary invariant polynomials**.

In fact, any invariant polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial of these elementary invariant polynomials. Suppose $f : \mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}$ is an invariant polynomial. Consider the polynomial $$F(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = f(\mathrm{diag}\{x_1, \cdots, x_n\}),$$ which is symmetric in $x_1, \cdots, x_n$. Then there exists a polynomial $g$ such that $$F(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = g(\sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_n),$$ where $\sigma_k$ is the elementary symmetric polynomial in $x_1, \cdots, x_n$ of degree $k$. It follows that $$f(A) = g(P_1(A), \cdots, P_n(A))$$ holds for any diagonalizable matrix $A$, and hence holds for any matrix $A \in \mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$.

Now consider an $k$-linear form $$\tilde{P} : \mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb{C}) \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}.$$ We say that $\tilde{P}$ is invariant if $$\tilde{P}(A_1, \cdots, A_k) = \tilde{P}(GA_1G^{-1}, \cdot, GA_kG^{-1})$$ holds for any $A_1, \cdots, A_k \in \mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $G \in \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. We see that each invariant $k$-linear form $\tilde{P}$ gives an invariant polynomial $P$ of degree $k$ by $$P(A) = \tilde{P}(A, \cdots, A).$$ Conversely, it can be verified that each invariant polynomial $P$ of degree $k$ admits a symmetric invariant $k$-form $\tilde{P}$ such that $P$ and $\tilde{P}$ are related as above. Such $\tilde{P}$ is actually unique and is called the **polarization** of $P$.

<!-- Main theorem -->
Suppose $\pi : E \to M$ is a complex vector bundle of rank $n$ and $D$ is a connection on $E$ with curvature $\Omega$. Consider an open subset $U \subset M$ with a local frame $e^1, \cdots, e^n$ of $E$ on $U$. With respect to this frame, the connection $D$ has a connection matrix $A$ and a curvatire matrix $\Theta$. Noting that the wedge product of forms of even degree is commutative, the expression $P(\Theta)$ gives a well-defined $2k$-form on $U$ for each invariant polynomial $P$ of degree $k$. Since the curvature matrix with respect to different frames only differ by a conjugation, we see that $P(\Omega)$ with local expression $P(\Theta)$ is a well-defined $2k$-form on $M$. 

**Theorem.** Suppose $\pi : E \to M$ is a complex vector bundle on a smooth manifold $M$ and $\Omega$ is the curvature of a given connection $D$ on $E$. If $P$ is an invariant polynomial of degree $k$, then $\mathrm{d}P(\Omega) = 0$ and the cohomology class $[P(\Omega)]$ in the de Rham cohomology group $H^{2k}(M; \mathbb{C})$ is independent of the choice of the connection on $E$.

The above theorem gives for each complex vector bundle $E \to M$ a homomorphism from the graded algebra $\Phi$ of invariant polynomials to the graded algebra $H^{2*}(M; \mathbb{C})$ given by $P \mapsto [P(\Omega)]$ where $\Omega$ is the curvature of any connection on $E$. This homomorphism is called the *Chern-Weil homomorphism*.

Let $P_k$ denote the elementary invariant polynomial of degree $k$. We define the **Chern form** $c_k(E, \Omega)$ of the connection $D$ on $E$ by $$c_k(E, \Omega) = P_k\left(\frac{i}{2 \pi}\Omega\right),$$ where $\Omega$ is the curvature of $D$. The **Chern class** $c_k(E)$ is then defined by $$c_k(E) = [c_k(E, \Omega)] = \left[P_k\left(\frac{i}{2\pi}\Omega\right)\right] \in H^{2k}(M; \mathbb{C}).$$ The **total Chern class** $c(E)$ is the sum of the Chern classes $$c(E) = \sum_{k \geq 0} c_k(E) \in H^*(M; \mathbb{C}),$$ where we set $c_0(E) = 1 \in H^0(M; \mathbb{C})$. If $M$ is a complex manifold, then we take the *Chern classes* $c_k(M)$ of $M$ to be the Chern classes of its holomorphic tangent bundle $\mathcal{T}_M = T^{1,0}(M)$. 

By the independence of the Chern classes with the connection, we can see the Chern classes must be real. Indeed, consider an hermitian metric on $E$ and a connection $D$ on $E$ compatible with the hermitian structure. Then the corresponding curvature $\Omega$ is skew-hermtitian, i.e., $\bar{\Omega}^\mathrm{T} = -\Omega$. Hence we have $$\overline{c(E, \Omega)} = \overline{\det\left(I + \frac{i}{2\pi}\Omega\right)} = \det\overline{\left(I + \frac{i}{2\pi}\Omega\right)} = \det\left(I + \frac{i}{2\pi}\Omega\right)^\mathrm{T} = c(E, \Omega),$$ implying that $c(E) = [c(E, \Omega)] \in H^*(M; \mathbb{R})$. 

<!-- Chern class of induced bundles -->

+ Suppose $E_1$ and $E_2$ are complex vector bundles on $M$, with curvature $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$. The curvature on the direct sum $E_1 \oplus E_2$ is given by $$\Omega = \begin{pmatrix} \Omega_1 & \\ & \Omega_2 \end{pmatrix},$$ and hence $$c(E, \Omega) = \det\left(I + \frac{i}{2\pi}\Omega\right) = \det\begin{pmatrix} I + (i/2\pi)\Omega_1 & \\ & I + (i/2\pi)\Omega_2 \end{pmatrix} = \det\left(I + \frac{i}{2\pi}\Omega_1) \cdot \det\left(I + \frac{i}{2\pi}\Omega_2\right) = c(E_1, \Omega_1) \cdot c(E_2, \Omega_2).$$ Thus $$c(E) = c(E_1) \cdot c(E_2).$$ 
+ Suppose $E$ is a complex vector bundle of rank $r$ on $M$ with curvature $\Omega$ and $L$ is a line bundle on $M$ with curvature $\omega \in A^2_\mathbb{C}(M)$. Then the curvature of $E \otimes L$ is given by $$\Omega \otimes 1 + I \otimes \omega = \omega \cdot I + \Omega.$$ It follows that $$c_1(E \otimes L) = \left[\frac{i}{2\pi}\mathrm{tr}\left(\omega \cdot I + \Omega)\right] = c_1(E) + r \cdot c_1(L).$$ More generally, if $F$ is a complex vector bundle of rank $s$, then $$c_1(E \otimes F) = s \cdot c_1(E) + r \cdot c_1(F).$$
+ The curvature $\Omega^*$ of the dual bundle $E^*$ is given by $$\Omega^* = -\Omega^\mathrm{T},$$ implying that $$\det\left(I + \frac{i}{2pi}\Omega^*\right) = \det\left(I - \frac{i}{2\pi}\Omega\right).$$ It follows that $$c_k(E^*) = (-1)^k c_k(E).$$ 
+ If $f : N \to M$ is a smooth map, then the curvature on the pullback bundle $f^*E$ is exactly $f^*\Omega$. Thus the Chern classes of $f^*E$ is given as $$c_k(f^*E) = f^*c_k(E).$$
