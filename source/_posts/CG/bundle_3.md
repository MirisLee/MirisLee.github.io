On vector bundles (not neccesarily holomorphic) on a complex manifold, we may consider metrics and connections analogously to the real case. These induce the notion of curvature and Chern class and turn out to be important tools in complex geometry.

## Hermitian metric on vector bundles and hermitian manifolds

Suppose $\pi : E \to M$ is a complex vector bundle on a smooth manifold $M$. Then a **hermitian metric** $h$ on $E$ is a hermitian inner product $h_x$ on each fiber $E_x$ depending smoothly on $x \in M$. More precisely, for any open subset $U \subset M$ and smooth sections $s_1, s_2$ of $E$ on $U$, the map $x \maspto h_x(s_1(x), s_2(x))$ is a smooth function on $U$. A complex vector bundle together with a hermitian metric is called a **hermitian vector bundle**.

Using local frame of $E$ on an open subset $U$, a hermitian metric on $E|_U$ is equivalent to a positive definite hermitian matrix consisting of smooth functions on $U$. Applying the partition of unity theorem, we see that any complex vector bundle on a smooth manifold admits a hermitian metric. 

Now suppose $M$ is a complex manifold. If the holomorphic tangent bundle $T^{1,0}(M)$ of $M$ admits a hermitian metric $h$, then we also call $h$ a hermitian metric on $M$. A complex manifold together with a hermitian metric is called a **hermitian manifold**. 

For each point $x \in M$, the hermitian metric $h$ gives a hermitian form $$h_x : T^{1,0}_x(M) \otimes \overline{T^{1,0}_x(M)} \to \mathbb{C},$$ or equivalently $$h_x \in (T^{1,0}_x(M) \otimes \overline{T^{1,0}_x(M)})^* = (T^{1,0}_x(M) \otimes T^{0,1}_x(M))^* = T^{*1,0}_x(M) \otimes T^{*0,1}_x(M).$$ Thus $h$ can be identified with a section of the vector bundle $T^{*1,0}(M) \otimes T^{*0,1}(M)$. If $(z^1, \cdots, z^n)$ is a local coordinate of $M$, then the hermitian metric $h$ can be expressed as $$h = \sum_{j,k=1}^n h_{j{\bar{k}} \mathrm{d}z^j \otimes \mathrm{d}\bar{z}^k,$$ where $$h_{j\bar{k}} = h\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z^j}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z^k\right), \quad j,k = 1, \cdots, n.$$

Consider the composition with the natural $\mathbb{R}$-linear isomorphism given by $$T_{\mathbb{R},x}(M) \to T_{\mathbb{C},x}(M) \to T^{1,0}_x(M)$$ for each $x \in M$, we obtain a bilinear form $$h : T_{\mathbb{R},x}(M) \otimes T_{\mathbb{R},x}(M) \to \mathbb{C}.$$ This bilinear form can also be constructed by viewing $T_{\mathbb{R},x}(M)$ as a subspace $T_{mathbb{C},x}(M)$ and extending the hermitian form on $T^{1,0}_x(M)$ to $T_{\mathbb{C},x}(M)$ by zero. Thus the real part of $h$ gives a symmetric bilinear form $$\mathrm{Re}(h) : T_{\mathbb{R},x}(M) \otimes T_{\mathbb{R},x}(M) \to \mathbb{R},$$ which is further an inner product by the positive definite property of $h$, while the imaginary part of $h$ gives an alternating form $$\mathrm{Im}(h) : T_{\mathbb{R},x}(M) \otimes T_{\mathbb{R},x}(M) \to \mathbb{R},$$ which determines an element in $\wedge^2 T^*_{\mathbb{R},x}(M)$. Therefore we obatin a Riemannian metric $\mathrm{Re}(h) on $M$, called the *associated Riemannian metric* of $h$, and a real differential $2$-form $$\omega = -\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Im}(h) \in A^2_{\mathbb{R}}(M)$$ on $M$, called the **fundamental form** of $h$. Noting that $\mathrm{Im}(h)$ can also be viewed as an alternating hermitian form on $T^{1,0}_x(M)$ for each $x$, we see that $\omega$ is also a $(1,1)$-form, i.e., $$\omega \in A^2_{\mathbb{R}}(M) \cap A^{1,1}(M).$$ 

We consider the explicit expression of $\mathrm{Re}(h)$ and $\omega$ in local coordinates. Direct computation yields that $$\mathrm{Re}(h) = \sum_{j,k=1}^n [\mathrm{Re}(h_{j\bar{k}})(\mathrm{d}x^j \otimes \mathrm{d}x^k + \mathrm{d}y^j \otimes \mathrm{d}y^k) + \mathrm{Im}(h_{j\bar{k}})(\mathrm{d}x^j \otimes \mathrm{d}y^k - \mathrm{d}y^j \otimes \mathrm{d}x^k)],$$ and that $$\omega = \sum_{j,k=1}^n \mathrm{Re}(h_{j\bar{k}}) \mathrm{d}x^j \wedge \mathrm{d}y^k - \sum_{1 \leq j < k \leq n} \mathrm{Im}(h_{j\bar{k}})(\mathrm{d}x^j \wedge \mathrm{d}x^k + \mathrm{d}y^j \wedge \mathrm{d}y^k) = \frac{i}{2}\sum_{j,k=1}^n h_{j\bar{k}}\mathrm{d}z^j \wedge \mathrm{d}\bar{z}^k.$$

Suppose $f : N \to M$ is a holomorphic map such that the holomorphic tangent map $$f_* : T^{1,0}_x(N) \to T^{1,0}_{f(x)}(M)$$ is injective for any $x \in N$. Then we may define a hermitian metric $\tilde{h}$ on $N$ by $$\tilde{h}_x(u_x, v_x) = h_{f(x)}(f_*u_x, f_*v_x), \quad u_x, v_x \in T^{1,0}_x(M).$$ Viewing a hermitian metric as a section of the tensor bundle, we see that $\tilde{h}$ is exactly the image of $h$ under the pullback $$f^* : T^{*1,0}(M) \otimes T^{*0,1}(M) \to T^{*1,0}(N) \otimes T^{*1,0}(N).$$ Suppose $\tilde{\omega}$ is the fundamental form of $\tilde{h}$. Then it can be verified that $$\tilde{\omega} = f^*\omega.$$ 

Consider a local coordinate $z^1, \cdots, z^n$ of $M$ such that $\partial / \partial z^1, \cdots, \partial / \partial z^n$ form an orthonormal basis locally. Such local coordinate exists by the Gram-Schimdt process. With respect to this basis, we see that $$h = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathrm{d}z^j \otimes \mathrm{d}\bar{z}^j, \quad \mathrm{Re}(h) = \sum_{j=1}^n (\mathrm{d}x^j \otimes \mathrm{d}x^j + \mathrm{d}y^j \otimes \mathrm{d}y^j), \quad \omega = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathrm{d}x^j \wedge \mathrm{d}y^j.$$ The associated volumn form $\mathrm{d}V$ to the Riemannian metric $\mathrm{Re}(h)$ is given by $$\mathrm{d}V = \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \mathrm{d}y^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n \wedge \mathrm{d}y^n.$$ Direct computation then yields that $$\omega^n = n! \cdot \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \mathrm{d}y^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n \wedge \mathrm{d}y^n = n! \cdot \mathrm{d}V.$$ Now suppose $N$ is a $k$-dimensional complex submanifold of $M$. Then we have the following formula, which is called the *Wirtinger theorem*, $$\mathrm{Vol}(N) = \int_N \mathrm{d}V_N = \frac{1}{k!} \int_N (\omega|_N)^k = \frac{1}{k!} \int_N \omega^k.$$ 

We could say more about the fundamental form of a hermitian metric. Indeed, any real $(1,1)$-form on $M$ determines a hermitian form on $M$. Suppose we have a real $(1,1)$-form $\omega$ on $M$ expressed locally as $$\omega = \frac{i}{2}\sum_{j,k=1}^n h_{j\bar{k}}\mathrm{d}z^j \wedge \mathrm{d}\bar{z}^k.$$ Then $h_{j\bar{k}}$ form a hermitian matrix and hence determines a hermitian form on $M$ locally. As $\omega$ is actually independent of coordinates, this hermitian form should be independent of coordinates as well. If the corresponding matrix $(h_{j\bar{k}})$ is positive definite everywhere, then $\omega$ actually defines a hermitian metric on $M$. Such $\omega$ is called a *positive $(1,1)$-form*, and we see a correspondence between hermitian metrics and positive $(1,1)$-form on $M$. 

We end this part with some examples.

+ The hermitian metric on $\mathbb{C}^n$ given as $$h = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbb{d}z^j \otimes \mathbb{d}\bar{z}^j$$ is called the *Euclidean metric*. The associated Riemannian matric is exactly the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{C}^n = \mathbb{R}^{2n}$.
+ Suppose $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ is a lattice generated by $2n$ real-linearly independent vectors. Then there is a standard hermitian metric on the complex torus $\mathbb{C}^n / \Lambda$ given by $$h = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbb{d}z^j \otimes \mathbb{d}\bar{z}^j,$$ which is also called the *Euclidean metric$.
+ There is a hermitian metric on $\mathbb{P}^n$ called the *Fubini-Study metric* constructed as follows. Note that it suffices to give a positive $(1,1)-form on $\mathbb{P}^n$. Consider the real $(1,1)$-form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus 0$ given by $$\omega_0 = \frac{i}{2 \pi}\partial\bar{\partial} \log |z|^2.$$ If $F_U : U \to \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus 0$ is a lifting of the covering map $\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setmius 0 \to \mathbb{P}^n$ on an open set $U \subset \mathbb{P}^n$, then $$F_U^*\omega_0 = \frac{i}{2 \pi}\partial\bar{\partial} \log |F_U|^2$$ is a real $(1,1)$-form on $U$. For two lifting $F_U$ and $F_V$ on $U$ and $V$, respectively, there is a nonzero holomorphic function $\psi$ such that $F_U = \psi \cdot F_V$ on $U \cap V$, implying that on the intersection $$F_U^*\omega_0 = \frac{i}{2 \pi}\partial\bar{\partial} (\log |F_V|^2 + \log \psi + \log \bar{\psi}) = F_V^*\omega_0 + \frac{i}{2 \pi}(\partial \bar{\partial} \log \psi - \bar{\partial} \partial \log \bar{\psi}) = F_V^*\omega_0.$$ Thus these pullbacks glue together to a real $(1,1)$-form $\omega$ on the whole $\mathbb{P}^n$. To see that $\omega$ is positive, noting that $U(n+1)$ acts transitively on $\mathbb{P}^n$ and leaves $\omega$ invariant, it suffices to show $\omega$ gives a postive definite hermitian form at one point. Using the local coordinate $w^j = z^k / z^0, k = 1, \cdots, n$ around $[1 : 0 : \cdots : 0]$, we see that at $[1 : 0 : \cdots : 0]$, $\omega$ is given as $$\omega = \frac{i}{2 \pi} \sum_{j=1}^n \mathrm{d}w^j \wedge \mathrm{d}\bar{w}^j,$$ which is clearly postive definite. 

## Connections on vector bundles

In analogy to real case, we need connections on vector bundles to compare different fibers.

Suppose $\pi : E \to M$ is a complex vector bundle on a complex manifold $M$. Consider the sheaf $\mathcal{A}^n_M(E)$ of smooth sections of the tensor bundle $\wedge^n T_\mathbb{C}^*(M) \otimes E$, whose sections are usually called *$E$-valued $n$-forms*, and the sheaf $\mathcal{A}^{p,q}_M(E)$ of smooth sections of the tensor bundle $T^{p,q}(M) \otimes E$, whose sections are called *$E$-valued $(p,q)$-forms*. Noting that $\mathcal{A}^0_M(E)$ is exactly the sheaf of smooth sections of $E$. 

A **connection** $D$ on $E$ is a sheaf homomorphism $$D : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^1_M(E)$$ satisfying the Leibniz' rule $$D(fs) = \mathrm{d}f \otimes s + f \cdot D(s),$$ for any $f \in C^\infty(U)$ and $s \in \mathcal{A}^0_M(E)(U)$on an open subset $U \subset M$. 

We can express a connection $D$ in a local frame. Suppose $e^1, \cdots, e^r$ form a local frame of $E$, i.e., they are sections of $E$ on an open subset $U \subset M$ such that $e^1(x), \cdots, e^r(x)$ form a basis of $E_x$ for each $x \in M$. Then there are differential $1$-forms $\omega^j_k on $U$ such that $$D(e^j) = \sum_{k=1}^r \omega^j_k \otimes e^k, \quad j = 1, \cdots, r.$$ We obtain a matrix $A = (\omega^j_k)$ of $1$-forms on $U$, called the **connection matrix** of $D$ with respect to the local frame $e^!, \cdots, e^r$. Conversely, given a matrix $A = (\omega^j_k)$ of $1$-forms, we may define a connection on $U$ by $$D(s) = \sum_{j=1}^r (\mathrm{d}s_j + \sum_{k=1}^r s_k \omega^k_j) \otimes e^j, \quad s = \sum_{j=1}^r s_j e^j.$$ 

The connection matrix depends on the choice of the local frame. Suppose $\tilde{e}^1, \cdots, \tilde{e}^r$ is another frame, with corresponding connection matrix $\tilde{A}$. The relations between two frames is given by a transformation matrix $G = (g^j_k)$ such that $$\tilde{e}^j = \sum_{k=1}^r g^j_k e^k.$$ Then we have $$D(\tilde{e}^j) = \sum_{k=1}^r (\mathrm{d}g^j_k + \sum_{l=1}^r g^j_l \omega^l_k) \otimes e^k,$$ implying that $$\tilde{A} = \mathrm{d}G \cdot G^{-1} + G \cdot A \cdot G^{-1}.$$ This is the transformation formula of connection matrices. 

Using the connection, we can consider the directional derivatives of sections. Suppose $D$ is a connection on a complex vector bundle $E$ on $M$. For $x \in M$, $s$ a section of $E$ on a neighborhood of $x$, and a tangent vector $X \in T_{\mathbb{C},x}(M)$, the *directional derivative* of $s$ at $x$ along the direction of $X$ is given by $$D_X(s) = (D(s)(x), X) \in E_x,$$ where the pairing $$(T^*_{\mathbb{C},x}(M) \otimes E_x) \otimes T_{\mathbb{C},x}(M) \to E_x$$ comes from the natural pairing $$T^*_{\mathbb{C},x}(M) \otimes T_{\mathbb{C},x}(M) \to \mathbb{C}.$$ If $X$ is instead a tangent vector field near $p$, then $D_X(s)$ gives a section of $E$ near $p$. 

Suppose $\gamma : [a,b] \to M$ is a smooth curve from $\gamma(a) = x$ to $\gamma(b) = y$. For each $t_0 \in [a,b]$, we can define the tangent vector of the curve at $t_0$ to be $$\dot{\gamma}(t_0) = \gamma_*\left(\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=t_0}\right).$$ If $s$ is a section of $E$ on a neighborhood of this curve, then the value of $D_{\dot{\gamma}}(s)$ only depends on the value of $s$ on $\gamma$. If $s$ is a section of $E$ on $\gamma$ such that $D_{\dot{\gamma}}(s) = 0$, then we call $s$ a section of $E$ **parallel** along $\gamma$, and the vector $s(y) \in E_y$ is called the **parallel displacement** is $s(x) \in E_x$ along $\gamma$. 

The choice of connections on a vector bundle is in general not canonical. However, if we consider more structure on the vector bundle and require the connection satisfying some compatible condition, then the choice becomes unique. 

First suppose $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle on a complex manifold $M$. Using the decomposition $$T_\mathbb{C}^*(M) = T^{*1,0}(M) \oplus T^{*0,1}(M),$$ we have $$\mathcal{A}^1_M(E) = \mathcal{A}^{1,0}_M(E) \oplus \mathcal{A}^{0,1}_M(E).$$ Thus we may write a connection $D$ as $$D = D^{1,0} + D^{0,1},$$ with $$D^{1,0} : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^{1,0}_M(E), \quad D^{0,1} : \mathcal{A]^0_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^{0,1}_M(E).$$ 

Note that since $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle, $\bar{\partial}$ gives a well-defined sheaf homomorphism $$\bar{\partial} : \mathcal{A}^{p,q}_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^{p,q+1}_M(E).$$ Indeed, suppose $e^1, \cdots, e^r$ is a local holomorphic frame of $E$ and $s$ is an $E$-valued $(p,q)$-form on $U$, then we can write $s$ as $$s = \sum_{k=1}^r \omega_k \otimes e^k, \quad \omega_k \in A^{p,q}(U).$$ We define $\bar{\partial}s$ to be the section $$\bar{\partial}s = \sum_{k=1}^r \bar{\partial}\omega_k \otimes e^k.$$ To check this is independent of the choice of the frame, consider another holomorphic frame $\tilde{e}^1, \cdots, \tilde{e}^r$ with $$e^k = \sum_{j=1}^r g^k_j \tilde{e}^j, \quad k = 1, \cdots, r.$$ Then the coefficients $g^k_j$ are holomorphic functions on $U$. With respect to this new frame, we have $$s = \sum_{k=1}^r \omega_k \otimes e^k = \sum_{j,k=1}^r g^k_j\omega_k \otimes \tilde{e}^j,$$ and hence $$\bar{\partial}s = \sum_{j=1}^r \bar{\partial\left(\sum_{k=1}^r g^k_j\omega_k\right) \otimes e^k = \sum_{j=1}^r \left(\sum_{k=1}^r g^k_j \bar{\partial}\omega_k\right) \otimes e^k = \sum_{k=1}^r \bar{\partial}\omega_k \otimes e^k.$$ This shows that $\bar{\partial}$ is well-defined. 

In particular, we have a sheaf homomorphism $$\bar{\partial} : \mathcal{A}^0_M(E) \to \mathcal{A}^{0,1}_M(E).$$ A connection $D$ on $E$ is called a **complex connection**, i.e., a connection compatible with the holomorphic structure, if $D^{0,1} = \bar{\partial}$. Using this definiton it is not hard to verify the following proposition.

**Proposition.** Suppose $\pi : E \to M$ is a holomorphic vector bundle on a complex manifold and $D$ is a connection on $E$. Then $D$ is a complex connection if and only if with respect to any local holomorphic frame of $E$, the connection matrix of $D$ consists of $(1,0)$-forms. 

Now suppose $E$ is further a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle on $M$ with hermitian metric $h$. Then $h$ induces a hermitian inner product at each $x \in M$. If $D$ is a connection on $E$ such that the parallel displacement induced by $D$ always preserves the inner product of two holomorpic tangent vectors, then we say $D$ is **compatible with the hermitian metric $h$**. We may also verify that $D$ is compatibe with $h$ if and only if for each holomorphic sections $s_1, s_2$ of $E$, we have $$\mathrm{d} h(s_1, s_2) = h(Ds_1, s_2) + h(s_1, Ds_2),$$ where the pairing $$h : (T^*_{\mathbb{C},x}(M) \otimes E_x) \otimes \overline{E_x} \to T^*_{\mathbb{C},x}(M)$$ and $$h : E_x \otimes \overline{(T^*_{\mathbb{C},x}(M) \otimes E_x)} \to T^*_{\mathbb{C},x}(M)$$ comes from the pairing $$h : E_x \otimes \overline{E_x} \to \mathbb{C}.$$ 

**Theorem.** Suppose $\pi : E \to M$ is a holomorphic vector bundle on a complex manifold $M$ with a hermitin metric $h$. Then there is a unique complex connection $D$ on $E$ compatible with $h$, called the **metric connection** on $E$. 

> *Proof:* Suppose $e^1, \cdots, e^r$ is a local holomorphic frame of $E$, and let $h^{j\bar{k}} = h(e^j, e^k)$. Assume that such connection $D$ exists, and the connection matrix of $D$ with respect to $e^1, \cdots, e^r$ is $A = (\omega^j_k)$. Then $\omega^j_k$ must be $(1,0)$-forms. Consider the inverse matrix $H^{-1} = (h_{\bar{j}k)$ of $H = (h^{j\bar{k}})$, that is $$\sum_{l=1}^r h_{\bar{j}l}h^{l\bar{k}} = \sum_{l=1}^r h_{\bar{l}j}h^{k\bar{l}} = \delta^k_j.$$ Since $D$ is compatible with $h$, we have the equation $$\partial h^{j\bar{k}} + \bar{\partial} h^{j\bar{k}} = \mathrm{d} h^{j\bar{k}} = \sum_{l=1}^r (h^{l\bar{k}}\omega^j_l + h^{j\bar{l}}\bar{\omega}^k_l),$$ or equivalently, $$\partial h^{j\bar{k}} = \sum_{l=1}^r h^{l\bar{k}} \omega^j_l, \quad \bar{\partial} h^{j\bar{k}} = \sum_{l=1}^r h^{j\bar{l} \bar{\omega}^k_l.$$ This has a unique solution given by $$\omega^j_k = \sum_[l=1}^r \partial h^{j\bar{l}} \cdot h_{\bar{l}k}.$$ Thus we have a uniquely determined connection $D$ on $E$ satisfying all the condition.
