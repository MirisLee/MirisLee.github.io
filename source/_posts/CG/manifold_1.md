Complex manifolds are basic objects in complex geometry, just like smooth manifolds are basic objects in differential geometry. We introduce complex manifolds as an analogy of smooth manifolds. Yet it is worth noting some differences between the complex case and the real case.  

<!-- Complex manifolds; holomorphic maps -->
## Definition and examples

A **complex manifold** $M$ (of dimension $n$) is a $2n$-dimensional smooth manifold with an open cover $U_\alpha$ and coordinate maps $\varphi_\alpha : U_\alpha \to \mathbb{C}^n$, such that $\varphi_\beta \circ \varphi_\alpha^{-1}$ is holomorphic on $\varphi_\alpha(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \subset \mathbb{C}^n$. 

Like the real case, we can define *holomorphic functions* on a complex manifold and *holomorphic maps* between complex manifolds. A holomorphic map $f : M \to N$ which has a holomorphic inverse $f^{-1} : N \to M$ is called a **holomorphic homeomorphism**. 

The holomorphic condition is actually a quite strong restriction to functions. This can be seen from the following proposition. 

**Proposition.** Any holomorphic function on a compact connected complex manifold $M$ is constant. 

> *Proof:* Suppose $f : M \to \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic. Since $M$ is compact, the continuous function $|f|$ attains its maximum at some point $x \in M$. Consider a coordinate chart $(U, \varphi)$ with $x \in U$. Then the maximal module principal on $\varphi(U) \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ implies that $f \circ \varphi^{-1}$ is constant. As $M$ is connected, $f$ must be constant on the whole $M$. 

The above proposition suggests that any compact connected complex manifold cannot be holomorphicly embedded in any $\mathbb{C}^m$. However, we still want to put a compact complex manifold into some good space. That is why we introduce the projective spaces. 

<!-- Projective spaces; complex tori -->

Use $z = (z^0, \cdots, z^n)$ to specify a point in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. Define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus 0$ by that $z \sim w$ if and only if $z = \lambda w$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}^*$. The collection $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus 0) / \sim$ of equivalence classes is called the **($n$-dimensional) projective space**, denoted by $\mathbb{P}^n$. The equivalence class containing $z = (z^0, \cdots, z^n)$ is denoted by $[z] = [z^0 : \cdots : z^n]$, with $z^0, \cdots, z^n$ called the *homogeneous coordinates* of $[z^0 : \cdots : z^n]$. 

Similar to the real case, we can show that $\mathbb{P}^n$ is an $n$-dimensional complex manifold. Consider the unit sphere $S^{2n+1} \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. The restriction of the natural projection $\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus 0 \to \mathbb{P}^n$ to $S^{2n+1}$ gives a continuous surjection onto $\mathbb{P}^n$. Since $S^{2n+1}$ is compact, $\mathbb{P}^n$ is also compact. 

The projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ can be viewed as a compactification of $\mathbb{C}^n$. Consider the inclusion $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{P}^n$ given by $$(z^1, \cdots, z^n) \mapsto [1 : z^1 : \cdots : z^n].$$ This inclusion is a holomorphic homeomorphism from $\mathbb{C}^n$ to an open subset of $\mathbb{P}^n$, and the complement of its image is naturally identified with $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. When $n = 1$, we see that $$\mathbb{P}^1 = \mathbb{C} \cup \mathbb{P}^0 = \mathbb{C} \cup \infty$$ is exactly the *Riemann sphere*. 

Another example of a compact complex manifold is a complex torus.  Suppose $v_1, \cdots, v_{2n} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ are linearly independent as vectors in a real vector space. Let $\Lambda = \mathbb{Z}v_1 + \cdots + \mathbb{Z}v_{2n}$ be the *lattice* generated by $v_1, \cdots, v_{2n}$. Then $\mathbb{C}^n / \Lambda$ is a compact smooth manifold together with a complex manifold structure induced from the covering map $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n / \Lambda$. This is called the **($n$-dimensional) complex torus**. We see that when $n = 1$, $\mathbb{C} / \Lambda$ is diffeomorphic to an ordinary torus $S^1 \times S^1$. 

<!-- Induced complex manifold structure from covering map; Hopf surface -->

We try to generalize the construction of the complex torus. Suppose $\pi : M \to N$ is a topological covering map and $M$ is a complex manifold. A *desk transformation* $f$ is a homeomorphism from $M$ to itself such that $f \circ \pi = \pi$. If each desk transformation on $M$ is holomorphic, then we can equip $N$ with a well-defined complex manifold structure induced from that of $M$. This is similar to the process that defines a quotient smooth manifold. 

Consider the group of self-homeomorphisms on $\mathbb{C}^2 \setminus 0$ generated by the map $z \mapsto 2z$. Let $M$ be the quotient smooth manifold of this group action. Then the natural projection $\mathbb{C}^2 \setminus 0 \to M$ gives a complex manifold structure on $M$, making $M$ into a $2$-dimensional complex manifold, called the **Hopf surface**. The Hopf surface is a compact complex manifold that cannot be embedded in any projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$. 

<!-- Tangent spaces & cotangent spaces -->
## Tangent spaces and cotangent spaces

Next we introduce the tangent space of a complex manifold. Suppose $M$ is a $n$-dimensional complex manifold and $p \in M$. Since $M$ is a $2n$-dimensional smooth manifold, we can consider the real tangent space $T_{\mathbb{R},p}(M)$ of $M$ at $p$. Let $$T_{\mathbb{C},p}(M) = T_{\mathbb{R},p}(M) \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$$ be the complexified tangent space. An element in $T_{\mathbb{C},p}(M)$, called a *complex tangent vector* of $M$ at $p$, is identified with a $\mathbb{C}$-linear derivation on the ring $C^\infty_p \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ of germs of complex-valued smooth functions on a neighborhood of $p$. 

Let $\mathcal{O}_p$ be the ring of germs of holomorphic functions around $p$, and $\overline{\mathcal{O}}_p$ be that of *antiholomorphic functions*, i.e., the functions whose conjugates are holomorphic. 

If a complex tangent vector $X \in T_{\mathbb{C},p}(M)$ vanishes on $\overline{\mathcal{O}}_p$, then we call $X$ a **holomorphic tangent vector**, and if $X$ vanishes on $\mathcal{O}_p$, then we call $X$ an **antiholomorphic tangent vector**. Then collection of all holomorphic (*resp.* antiholomorphic) tangent vectors is called the **holomorphic tangent space** (*resp.* **antiholomorphic tangent space**) of $M$ at $p$, denoted by $T^{1,0}_p(M)$ (*resp.* $T^{0,1}_p(M)$). 

We try to show that $T^{1,0}_p(M)$ and $T^{0,1}_p(M)$ are both $n$-dimensional complex linear spaces with 

$$T_{\mathbb{C},p}(M) = T^{1,0}_p(M) \oplus T^{0,1}_p(M).$$

Suppose $(U,z^k)$ is a holomorphic coordinate chart of $M$ around $p$, with $z^k = x^k + i y^k, 1 \leq k \leq n$. Then $\partial / \partial x^1, \cdots, \partial / \partial x^n, \partial / \partial y^1, \cdots, \partial / \partial y^n$ form a ($\mathbb{C}$-linear) basis of $T_{\mathbb{C},p}(M)$. Let $$\frac{\partial}{\partial z^k} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} - i \frac{\partial}{\partial y^k}\right), \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}^k} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial y^k}\right), \quad k = 1, \cdots, n.$$ Then Cauchy-Riemann equations imply that $\partial / \partial z^1, \cdots, \partial z^n$ form a basis of $T^{1,0}_p(M)$, while $\partial / \partial \bar{z}^1, \cdots, \partial / \partial \bar{z}^n$ form a basis of $T^{0,1}_p(M)$. The direct sum decomposition follows. 

We can also construct the corresponding cotangent spaces of $M$ at $p$. Let $T^*_{\mathbb{C},p}(M)$ be the dual space of $T_{\mathbb{C},p}(M)$, whose elements are called *complex cotangent vectors* of $M$ at $p$. A complex cotangent vector vanishing on $T^{0,1}_p(M)$ (*resp.* $T^{1,0}_p(M)$) is called a **holomorphic cotangent vector** (*resp.* **antiholomorphic cotangent vector**), and then we can similarly define the **holomorphic cotangent space** $T^{*1,0}_p(M)$ and the **antiholomorphic cotangent space** $T^{*0,1}_p(M)$. Note that $T^{*1,0}_p(M)$ can be naturally identified with the dual of $T^{1,0}_p(M)$, while $T^{*0,1}_p(M)$ is identified with the dual of $T^{0,1}_p(M)$. 

If we use the local coordinates $z^1, \cdots, z^n$ around $p$, then $\mathrm{d}x^1, \cdots, \mathrm{d}x^n, \mathrm{d}y^1, \cdots, \mathrm{d}y^n$ form a basis of $T^*_{\mathbb{C},p}(M)$. The corresponding bases of $T^{*1,0}_p(M)$ and $T^{*0,1}_p(M)$ are then given by $$\mathrm{d}z^k = \mathrm{d}x^k + i\mathrm{d}y^k, \quad k = 1, \cdots, n,$$ and $$\mathrm{d}\bar{z}^k = \mathrm{d}x^k - i\mathrm{d}y^k, \quad k = 1, \cdots, n$$ which are exactly the dual basis of $\partial / \partial z^1, \cdots, \partial / \partial z^n$ and $\partial / \partial \bar{z}^1, \cdots, \partial / \partial \bar{z}^n$, respectively. 

## Tangent maps and Jacobians

Since we have tangent spaces of a complex manifold, we can consider the corresponding tangent maps. Suppose $M$ and $N$ are complex manifolds of dimensional $m$ and $n$, respectively. Then any smooth map $f : M \to N$ with $f(p) = q$ induces a *tangent map* $$f_* : T_{\mathbb{R},p}(M) \to T_{\mathbb{R},q}(N)$$ and then a map $$f_* : T_{\mathbb{C},p}(M) \to T_{\mathbb{C},q}(N).$$ However, in general, this does not induce a *holomorphic tangent map* from $T^{1,0}_p(M)$ to $T^{1,0}_q(N)$, as well as a *antiholomorphic tangent map* from $T^{0,1}_p(M)$ to $T^{0,1}_q(N)$. 

**Proposition.** Suppose $M$ and $N$ are complex manifolds of dimensional $m$ and $n$, respectively, and $f : M \to N$ is a smooth map. Consider the tangent map $f_* : T_{\mathbb{C},p}(M) \to T_{\mathbb{C},q}(N)$. Then $f$ is holomorphic if and only if $f_*(T^{1,0}_p(M)) \subset T^{1,0}_q(N)$.
> *Proof:* Note that $f_*(T^{1,0}_p(M)) \subset T^{1,0}_q(N)$ is equivalent to that $g \circ f$ is antiholomorphic whenever $g$ is antiholomorphic. The latter is directly equivalent to that $f$ is holomorphic. 

Now suppose $f : M \to N$ is a holomorphic map. Consider the local coordinates $z^1, \cdots, z^m$ around $p \in M$ and the local coordinates $w^1, \cdots, w^n$ around $q = f(p) \in N$. The holomophic tangent map can be expressed by the *holomorphic Jacobian* $$J(f) = \left(\frac{\partial w^\alpha}{\partial z^j}\right),$$ Suppose $z^j = x^j + iy^j$ for $1 \leq j \leq m$ and $w^\alpha = u^\alpha + iv^\alpha$ for $1 \leq \alpha \leq n$. With respect to the bases $\partial / \partial x^j, \partial / \partial y^j$ and $\partial / \partial u^\alpha, \partial / \partial v^\alpha$, the real tangent map is given by the *real Jacobian* $$J_\mathbb{R}(f) = \begin{pmatrix} \partial u^\alpha / \partial x^j & \partial u^\alpha / \partial y^j \\\\ \partial v^\alpha / \partial x^j & \partial v^\alpha / \partial y^j \end{pmatrix}.$$ If we pass through the tensor product with $\mathbb{C}$ to consider the complex tangent map, and change our bases into $\partial / \partial z^j, \partial / \partial \bar{z}^j$ and $\partial / \partial w^\alpha, \partial / \partial \bar{w}^\alpha$, we obtain the *complex Jacobian* $$J_\mathbb{C}(f) = \begin{pmatrix} \partial w^\alpha / \partial z^j & \partial w^\alpha / \partial \bar{z}^j \\\\ \partial \bar{w}^\alpha / \partial z^j & \partial \bar{w}^\alpha / \partial \bar{z}^j \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} J(f) & \\\\ & \overline{J(f)} \end{pmatrix}.$$ 

Since $J_\mathbb{R}$ and $J_\mathbb{C}$ only differ by a change of basis, we have $$\mathrm{rank} J_\mathbb{R}(f) = \mathrm{rank} J_\mathbb{C}(f) = 2 \cdot \mathrm{rank} J(f).$$ Moreover, when $m = n$, we have $$\det J_\mathbb{R}(f) = \det J_\mathbb{C}(f) = \det J(f) \cdot \det \overline{J(f)} = |\det J(f)|^2 \geq 0.$$ As an corollary, any complex manifold is orientable, as we can fix a natural orientation on $\mathbb{C}^n$ by the $2n$-form $$\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^n \mathrm{d}z^1 \wedge \mathrm{d}\bar{z}^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}z^n \wedge \mathrm{d}\bar{z}^n = \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \mathrm{d}y^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n \wedge \mathrm{d}y^n,$$ and pull this back through the holomorphic coordinate maps. The pullbacks agree with each other on the intersections of coordinate neighborhoods and hence give a well-defined orientation on the $n$-dimensional complex manifold $M$.
